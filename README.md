# Predicting-AirBnB-Listing-Price-within-New-York-City-s-Boroughs

For this project, the motivation is to understand the features that affect listing pricing for AirBnB. 

The dataset is acquired from kaggle, and further SQL query is written to extract relevant data in Jupyter Notebook.

Lasso, Ridge regression and Random Forest models are generated to determine the most promising model for predicting the price.

From the project, it is determined that Random Forest model is better fit for prediction. 

As a result, it is determined that room type has a major impact on the pricing. 

This model can be improved by taking more features like seasons.
